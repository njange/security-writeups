# Security Writeups & Project Ideas

This repository contains CTF writeups, challenge analyses, and small project ideas related to low-level security research, blockchain exploitation, RISC-V experimentation, and related tooling.


## Goals for this repo

1. Collect detailed writeups of solved challenges with clear steps and technical rationale.
2. Keep small reproducible examples (scripts or minimal servers) to demonstrate vulnerabilities and defenses.
3. Curate ideas for future challenge creation or defensive patches (sandbox improvements, syscall hardening).

## Tools & Techniques

- Netcat (interactive service testing)
- Python (automation and brute-force scripts)
- RISC-V toolchain or assembler (for building and testing payloads)

## Contribution

PRs are welcome — please include a concise summary, reproduction steps, and any defensive recommendations when submitting new writeups.
